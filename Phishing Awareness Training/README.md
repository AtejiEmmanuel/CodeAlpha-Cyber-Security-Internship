## üîç Introduction

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers attempt to steal sensitive information by disguising themselves as trustworthy entities. These attacks remain one of the most common and effective methods for data breaches and security incidents.

This repository contains training materials to help individuals and organizations identify and defend against various phishing techniques.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

- Identify common types of phishing attacks
- Recognize red flags in suspicious emails, messages, and websites
- Understand the psychology behind phishing attempts
- Apply practical techniques to protect yourself and your organization
- Know the proper reporting procedures for suspected phishing attempts

## üé£ Types of Phishing Attacks

### Email Phishing
The most common form where attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate sources like banks, colleagues, or service providers.

### Spear Phishing
Targeted attacks directed at specific individuals or organizations, using personalized information to appear more convincing.

### Whaling
A form of spear phishing targeting high-profile executives or other high-value targets within an organization.

### Vishing (Voice Phishing)
Using phone calls to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or taking certain actions.

### Smishing (SMS Phishing)
Using text messages to lure victims into providing information or clicking on malicious links.

### Business Email Compromise (BEC)
Sophisticated scams targeting businesses that conduct wire transfers or have foreign suppliers.

### Clone Phishing

## üö© Red Flags: How to Spot Phishing

### Email Warning Signs

- **Urgent or threatening language**: Creating pressure to act quickly
- **Generic greetings**: "Dear Customer" instead of your name
- **Spelling and grammar errors**: Professional organizations typically have editing processes
- **Mismatched or suspicious email domains**: Example: support@amaz0n-security.com
- **Unexpected attachments**: Especially executable files (.exe, .scr, .zip)
- **Requests for sensitive information**: Legitimate organizations rarely ask for passwords via email
- **Offers that seem too good to be true**: Free gifts, prizes, or unexpected money

### Website Warning Signs

- **Missing or incorrect website information**: Check the "About Us," "Contact," and privacy pages
- **No HTTPS connection**: Look for the padlock icon in your browser address bar
- **Subtle URL differences**: Example: "paypa≈Ç.com" instead of "paypal.com"
- **Poor design quality**: Legitimate companies invest in professional web design
- **Redirects**: Being sent from one website to a completely different one

### Social Engineering Tactics to Watch For

- **Creating a sense of urgency**: "Act now or your account will be suspended"
- **Authority exploitation**: Impersonating executives or IT staff
- **Social proof**: "Everyone else in the department has already completed this"
- **Reciprocity**: Offering something to get something in return
- **Familiarity and trust**: Pretending to know you or someone you know

## üß† The Psychology Behind Phishing

Phishing attacks exploit natural human tendencies:

- **Fear**: Threats about account closure or security breaches
- **Curiosity**: Enticing subject lines or content that make you want to learn more
- **Trust**: Impersonating trusted individuals or organizations
- **Greed**: Offers of money, prizes, or exclusive deals
- **Helpfulness**: Most people naturally want to assist others
- **Automatic behaviors**: Taking action without thinking when faced with familiar scenarios

## üîí Practical Protection Techniques

### Email Safety

- **Verify the sender**: Check the actual email address, not just the display name
- **Hover before clicking**: Check link destinations by hovering your cursor over them
- **Think before you click**: Ask yourself if you were expecting this email or attachment
- **Use email filtering**: Make sure spam filters are active
- **Validate requests through other channels**: Call the person directly using a known number

### Account Security

- **Use strong, unique passwords** for each account
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** wherever available
- **Regularly update sensitive passwords**
- **Use a password manager** to securely store complex passwords

### Technical Safeguards

- **Keep software updated**: Set automatic updates when possible
- **Use security software**: Keep antivirus and anti-malware protection current
- **Enable email filtering**: Most providers offer enhanced phishing protection
- **Use browser tools**: Many browsers now include phishing protection features

## üö® Response Protocol

### Step-by-Step Response for Suspected Phishing

1. **Don't click links or download attachments**
2. **Don't reply to the message**
3. **Report the attempt** to your IT security team or designated contact
4. **Delete the message** after reporting
5. **If you clicked a link or provided information:**
   - Change affected passwords immediately
   - Contact relevant financial institutions if applicable
   - Monitor accounts for suspicious activity
   - Notify IT security immediately

### Proper Reporting Procedures

- Forward suspicious emails to your organization's designated reporting address
- Include details about why you found it suspicious
- Preserve original message headers when possible

## üìö Case Studies

### Case 1: The Urgent Executive Request

You receive an email seemingly from your CEO asking for an urgent wire transfer while they're traveling. The email mentions they're in meetings all day and can't be reached by phone.

**Red Flags:**
- Urgency and inability to verify through other channels
- Unusual request outside normal procedures
- Possibly slight differences in email address

**Correct Response:**
Verify the request through established channels, following company financial protocols.

### Case 2: The IT Support Password Reset

You receive an email from "IT Support" indicating your password will expire and providing a link to reset it immediately.

**Red Flags:**
- Generic greeting
- Urgent timeframe
- Request to enter current password on a website
- Link URL doesn't match your organization's official domain

**Correct Response:**
Contact IT support directly through official channels, not via information in the suspicious email.

### Case 3: The Delivery Notification

You receive an SMS about a package delivery issue with a link to "reschedule."

**Red Flags:**
- You weren't expecting a package
- Generic sender information
- Short URL that doesn't clearly indicate the delivery company
- Request for personal information after clicking

**Correct Response:**
If you're expecting a delivery, go directly to the shipping company's official website or app.

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **Verify before trusting**: Always confirm requests through official channels
2. **Slow down**: Phishing relies on quick, emotional responses
3. **Trust your instincts**: If something feels suspicious, it probably is
4. **Report promptly**: Your report could protect others in your organization
5. **Stay informed**: Phishing tactics evolve constantly
